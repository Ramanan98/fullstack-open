Suppose a team of 6 developers is working on a Python web application. Python is popular for backend services, APIs, and data-heavy tools, so it’s a reasonable choice here.

In the Python ecosystem, we can use pylint for linting. These help catch style issues, unused imports, and common coding errors. For testing, pytest is probably the most popular and flexible tool. It integrates well with most test runners and is easy to extend. If we need to build the app to a container, we can use a Dockerfile in combination with docker-compose if it's a multi-container set up. We can have a pipeline to push images to a cloud based registry.

Besides GitHub Actions and Jenkins, there are several other CI tools out there. GitLab CI/CD is a strong alternative, especially if we host our repo on GitLab. Bitbucket pipelines are also another option.

Whether to self-host or go with a cloud-based CI depends on a few things: Do we have sensitive data or private code that shouldn’t leave our network? Is build time becoming a bottleneck? Do we need special hardware or performance? For most small-to-medium teams, a cloud-based solution is probably better since it’s fast to set up, scalable, and we don’t have to maintain the infrastructure ourselves. But if we hit limitations or care deeply about control and privacy, self-hosting (for example, with a VPS) might be worth the extra effort.
